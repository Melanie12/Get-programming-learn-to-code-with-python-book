# Capstone Unit 3

#The problem
# You'll use conditionals and branching to create a story. At each scene, the user will enter a word.
# The word will tell the program which path to continue following.
# Your program should handle all possible paths that the user might choose, but doesn't need to handle any unexpected input from the user.
