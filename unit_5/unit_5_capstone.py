# Analyze your friends

# The problem
#Write a program that reads input from a file in a specific format, regarding all your friends' names and phone numbers. Your program should store that information and analyze it in some way.
# For example, you can show the user where their friends live based on the area code of the phone numbers, and the number of states where they live.
