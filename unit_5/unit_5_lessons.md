# What I learned in Unit 5
## Functions

In this unit, I mostly learned about functions.

Didn't know about the concept of Modularity and abstraction. I didn't know these concepts were common in programming.
Abstraction of a task is a way to simplify a task. In programming, for these tasks you don't need to know how each block of code works. You only need to know what inputs go into the task, what the task is supposed to do, and what output the task gives you. It's abstracting the programming task to these three pieces of information. It's also named a code module.
Later in the book, it says that abstraction aims to present ideas at high level, that's it's the process of documenting what a piece of code does, with three key bits of information : inputs, the task, and outputs.

While modularity is the division of a big program into smaller tasks. It's writing code for each task separately, independent of other tasks.

### Scope
I learned that a function's name can be called only on its scope.
Several functions can have the same name as long as they are not in the same scope.
But it's not a good practice to repeeat the name of variables.

### Nested functions
You can have nested functions.
Python knows only about an inner function inside the scope of the outer function and only when the outer function is being called.
